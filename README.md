# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project makes use of the Metals API. Metals API contains real-time prices of assets such as Bitcoin, Gold, Silver and more.

This is a project displaying assets users want to check the price of. There is a button
where once a user clicks on it, it makes a call (using Axios) to the Metals API to retrieve asset prices. There it will set hook variables to whatever the current values are.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
